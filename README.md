Threadly wants to create a Rails app for their commenting service. 
When a user types a comment into the box and clicks the Post button, the comment is saved into a database.
In the first turn of the request/response cycle, the list of all posts is displayed to the user.
When a user posts a comment, it triggers the second turn of the request/response cycle, where a new post is added to the database.
